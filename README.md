# Prism: Next-Generation Retail Supply Chain Transformation Platform

Prism is an advanced, research-driven, and solution-oriented project for transforming global and Indian retail supply chains. It combines deep technical research, pain point analysis, and demonstrable AI-powered solution blueprints—tailored for Walmart Sparkathon, innovation challenges, and enterprise transformation.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To empower supply chain leaders, innovators, and students with actionable research, technical deep-dives, and working prototypes that address the most complex challenges in modern retail logistics—especially for hyper-scale organizations like Walmart.

## 🧠 Research & Pain Point Analysis

- **Walmart’s Supply Chain (Global & India):**
  - Deep-dive technical blueprints, architecture diagrams, and technology stack breakdowns
  - AI/ML, IoT, automation, cloud, and sustainability initiatives
  - Strategic benchmarks vs. Amazon, Reliance, Flipkart
- **Pain Points:**
  - India retail: cold chain, last-mile, demand forecasting, regulatory, tech gaps, etc.
  - Walmart global/India: nuanced, next-gen pain points (fragmentation, resilience, ethical AI, etc.)
  - Visuals, data, and real-world case studies

## 💡 Solution Blueprints & Prototypes

### 1. Project Prism (s1)
- **Next-generation AI-driven supply chain resilience platform**
- Causal AI, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Federated Learning, and DAO for self-healing, adaptive, and proactive supply chains
- Designed for black swan events, cascading disruptions, and human-AI collaboration

### 2. Supply Chain Co-pilot (s2)
- **Causal AI-driven disruption simulator and decision support tool**
- Web-based, Python FastAPI backend (DoWhy/CausalML), React frontend
- Real-time “what-if” scenario analysis for supply chain managers
- Integrates with Walmart Luminate and Element AI data infrastructure

---

## 🏗️ Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, CausalML, DoWhy, SQLite
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, modular UI components
- **Data/AI:** Causal inference, simulation, scenario modeling
- **Research:** Markdown, PDF, and visual assets

---

## 📈 How to Use
1. **Explore Research:** Start in `research/` for deep technical and strategic context
2. **Understand Pain Points:** Use `pain_points/` and `walmart_pain_points/` for granular challenges
3. **Prototype Solutions:** Dive into `solution/` for working code, backend, and frontend
4. **Hackathon Ready:** Use blueprints and code for Sparkathon, innovation challenges, or enterprise pilots
