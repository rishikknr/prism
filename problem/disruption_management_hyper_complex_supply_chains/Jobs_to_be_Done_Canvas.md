# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Canvas: Disruption Management in Hyper-Complex Global Supply Chains

## Job Statement

**When** a major, unforeseen global supply chain disruption occurs (e.g., Red Sea crisis, geopolitical shock, climate event),

**I want to** accurately predict and model the cascading effects across millions of SKUs and hundreds of thousands of suppliers, and rapidly identify optimal interventions,

**So I can** minimize financial losses (lost sales, increased costs), ensure product availability, maintain customer satisfaction, and shift from reactive crisis management to proactive, automated resilience.

## Functional Job

**What is the core task the customer is trying to accomplish?**

*   Minimize the negative impact of unforeseen global supply chain disruptions on operations, costs, and customer satisfaction.
*   Ensure continuous product flow and availability despite external shocks.
*   Make rapid, data-driven decisions to mitigate disruption effects.

## Emotional Job

**How does the customer want to feel (or avoid feeling) while doing the job?**

*   **Avoid feeling:** Overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, reactive, helpless, responsible for significant financial losses, blamed for stockouts, fatigued by manual data analysis.
*   **Want to feel:** In control, confident, proactive, prepared, empowered, strategic, effective, secure, calm, trusted, innovative.

## Social Job

**How does the customer want to be perceived by others while doing the job?**

*   **Perceived as:** A strategic leader, a problem-solver, highly competent, resilient, innovative, forward-thinking, a guardian of the company's profitability and reputation, someone who can navigate extreme uncertainty effectively.
*   **Avoid being perceived as:** Incompetent, reactive, unprepared, overwhelmed, a source of financial losses, someone who lets the company down.

## Job Steps

**What are the steps the customer goes through to get the job done?**

1.  **Detect Disruption:** Identify an emerging global event that could impact the supply chain (e.g., news alerts, geopolitical shifts, climate warnings).
2.  **Assess Initial Impact:** Determine the immediate, direct effects on first-tier suppliers, routes, or costs.
3.  **Model Cascading Effects:** Predict how the disruption will propagate through the multi-tiered supply chain, affecting different SKUs, regions, and customer segments.
4.  **Identify Intervention Options:** Brainstorm and evaluate potential responses (e.g., alternative sourcing, rerouting, inventory reallocation, demand shaping).
5.  **Evaluate Intervention Effectiveness:** Simulate the impact of different interventions on costs, availability, and lead times.
6.  **Make Decision:** Select the optimal intervention strategy under uncertainty.
7.  **Execute Intervention:** Implement the chosen strategy.
8.  **Monitor & Adjust:** Track the actual impact of the disruption and the intervention, making real-time adjustments as needed.
9.  **Learn & Adapt:** Capture lessons learned to improve future disruption management capabilities.

## Desired Outcomes

**What specific outcomes does the customer want to achieve?**

*   **Reduced Time-to-Decision:** Significantly decrease the time taken to identify and respond to disruptions.
*   **Minimized Financial Losses:** Achieve a quantifiable reduction in lost sales, expedited shipping costs, and inventory write-offs.
*   **Maintained Product Availability:** Ensure critical products remain in stock and reach customers on time.
*   **Increased Predictive Accuracy:** Improve the accuracy of forecasts for cascading effects of novel disruptions.
*   **Enhanced Operational Agility:** Enable the supply chain to adapt quickly and seamlessly to unforeseen changes.
*   **Improved Human-AI Collaboration:** Foster trust and efficiency between human managers and AI systems.
*   **Proactive Resilience:** Shift from a reactive to a proactive stance in managing supply chain risks.
*   **Clear Visibility:** Gain comprehensive, real-time visibility into the entire supply chain and potential disruption impacts.

## Metrics for Desired Outcomes

**How will the customer measure if the desired outcomes are achieved?**

*   **Time-to-Decision:** Average time from disruption detection to intervention execution.
*   **Lost Sales %:** Percentage of sales lost due to stockouts caused by disruptions.
*   **Expedited Shipping Cost %:** Percentage of total logistics costs attributed to expedited shipping during disruptions.
*   **Inventory Write-off %:** Percentage of inventory value written off due to disruption-induced obsolescence.
*   **On-Shelf Availability %:** Percentage of products consistently available on shelves/online.
*   **Forecast Error Rate:** Reduction in forecast error for disruption-affected SKUs.
*   **Supply Chain Resilience Index:** A composite score reflecting the supply chain's ability to withstand and recover from shocks.
*   **User Satisfaction Score:** Feedback from supply chain managers on the utility and effectiveness of decision support tools.
