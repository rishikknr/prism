# Lean Canvas: Disruption Management in Hyper-Complex Global Supply Chains

## Problem

**Top 3 Problems:**

1.  **Inability to Predict Cascading Failures:** Current AI/ML models struggle with novel disruptions and accurately modeling second-order and third-order effects across a hyper-complex global supply chain.
2.  **Slow, Suboptimal Manual Interventions:** Supply chain managers are overwhelmed by data during crises, leading to delayed, reactive, and often suboptimal manual decision-making.
3.  **Significant Financial Exposure:** Unforeseen disruptions lead to substantial financial losses (e.g., $100M+ annual exposure, $12M lost sales from Red Sea crisis).

## Solution

**Top 3 Solutions:**

1.  **Advanced Causal AI/Probabilistic Programming:** Develop models that understand causal relationships to predict non-obvious cascading effects and identify optimal intervention points.
2.  **Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Re-planning:** Implement AI agents that can learn and execute optimal real-time re-planning decisions (re-routing, re-sourcing, inventory reallocation) under extreme uncertainty.
3.  **Explainable AI (XAI) for Human-AI Collaboration:** Provide clear, interpretable reasons behind AI recommendations to foster trust, reduce decision fatigue, and enable faster, more informed human interventions.

## Key Metrics

**Key Activities to Measure Success:**

*   Reduction in disruption-related financial losses (e.g., % decrease in stockouts, % decrease in expedited shipping costs).
*   Decrease in time-to-decision during supply chain disruptions.
*   Increase in supply chain resilience score (custom metric).
*   Improvement in forecast accuracy for novel disruption scenarios.
*   User adoption and satisfaction with new AI-powered decision support tools.
