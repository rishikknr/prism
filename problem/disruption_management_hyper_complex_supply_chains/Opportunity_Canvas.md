# Opportunity Canvas: Disruption Management in Hyper-Complex Global Supply Chains

## Problem

**What problem are we solving?**

Walmart India faces significant financial losses and operational inefficiencies due to its inability to effectively predict, model, and respond to the cascading effects of novel, hyper-complex global supply chain disruptions. Current advanced AI tools are powerful but lack the speed and predictive capability for truly proactive, automated resilience, leading to delayed, suboptimal manual interventions and an estimated $100M+ annual exposure.

## Solution

**What solution are we proposing?**
