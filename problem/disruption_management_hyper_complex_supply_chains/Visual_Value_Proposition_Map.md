**Explanation of the Visual Representation:**

This Mermaid diagram provides a visual representation of the Value Proposition Map. It clearly separates the **Customer Profile** (Jobs, Pains, Gains) from the **Value Map** (Products & Services, Pain Relievers, Gain Creators). The arrows indicate the relationships between these components, showing how the proposed solution's features and benefits directly address the customer's needs and challenges. This visual format helps to quickly grasp the core value proposition and the alignment between the problem and the solution.
