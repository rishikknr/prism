## 1. Current Supply Chain Architecture: End-to-End Technical Blueprint

### 1.1. Global Network Topology
- **Suppliers**: 100,000+ globally, with dynamic sourcing algorithms optimizing for cost, risk, and sustainability. India’s share: 2% (2018) → 25% (2024); China: 80% → 60%.
- **Inbound Logistics**: Multi-modal (ocean, rail, air, road), orchestrated by TMS (Manhattan, Blue Yonder, custom Walmart modules).
- **Distribution Centers (RDCs)**: 42 in the US, 200+ globally. Automated cross-docking, high-speed palletizing (Symbotic), and IoT-enabled asset tracking. Each DC is a node in a real-time digital twin network.
- **Fulfillment Centers (FCs)**: 31 e-commerce FCs, 4 next-gen (Joliet, IL: 1.5M sq ft, 75% US pop. in 2-day reach). Automated storage/retrieval (ASRS), Witron, and Alphabot robotics. FCs run on microservices for order orchestration, inventory sync, and last-mile routing.
- **Market Fulfillment Centers (MFCs)**: 100+ micro-fulfillment nodes, often store-adjacent, using ASRS and temperature-controlled robotics for fresh/grocery.
- **Stores**: 10,500+ globally, 4,600+ in the US. 65% served by automation. Stores act as forward-deployed inventory and last-mile nodes (BOPIS, curbside, gig delivery).
- **Last-Mile Delivery**: Mix of in-house fleet, gig economy (Spark, DoorDash), and EV pilots. Dynamic routing via AI/ML, real-time ETA prediction, and load balancing.
