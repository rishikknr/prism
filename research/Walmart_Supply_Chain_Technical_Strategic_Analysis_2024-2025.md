# Transforming Retail Supply Chains: In-Depth Technical & Strategic Analysis of Walmart‚Äôs Global and Indian Systems (2024-2025)

## üèóÔ∏è 1. Current Supply Chain Architecture

Walmart‚Äôs supply chain is a global, multi-tiered network connecting 100,000+ suppliers to 10,500+ stores and e-commerce platforms, serving 270 million customers weekly. The architecture includes:

- **Suppliers**: Sourced globally, with increasing diversification (notably, India‚Äôs share rose from 2% to 25% between 2018-2024; China‚Äôs fell from 80% to 60%).
- **Distribution Centers (RDCs)**: 42 regional hubs for bulk storage, cross-docking, and rapid inventory turnover (48-hour target).
- **Fulfillment Centers**: 31 e-commerce-focused, plus 4 next-gen automated centers (e.g., Joliet, IL) with double throughput and 20% lower unit costs.
- **Market Fulfillment Centers (MFCs)**: Micro-fulfillment, often store-adjacent, using ASRS for fast, local order picking.
- **Stores & Last-Mile**: 65% of stores served by automation; 93% of US households covered by omnichannel fulfillment. Last-mile includes in-house fleet, gig delivery, and EV pilots.

**E-commerce vs. Physical Retail**: E-commerce relies on dedicated fulfillment, real-time inventory sync, and last-mile optimization. Physical retail leverages cross-docking, store-based inventory, and in-person pickup. Omnichannel integration (e.g., BOPIS, curbside) blurs these lines.
