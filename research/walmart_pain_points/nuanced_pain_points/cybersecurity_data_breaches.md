For a large enterprise like Walmart/Flipkart, a major breach could easily exceed this, potentially reaching tens or even hundreds of crores depending on the scale and type of data compromised.
*   **Lost Business:** This is the largest component of breach costs, including customer churn, diminished reputation, and lost new business opportunities. This can account for over 30-40% of the total cost.
*   **Fines and Penalties:** With the impending Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act) in India, fines for data breaches can be up to INR 250 Crores (approximately $30 million) for significant non-compliance.
*   **Stock Price Impact:** Major cybersecurity incidents can lead to a temporary but significant drop in stock prices, impacting shareholder value.

## 5. Why is the Walmart Solution Failing?
Despite robust efforts, the solutions are not foolproof due to:
*   **Evolving Threat Landscape:** Cybercriminals constantly develop new attack vectors, making it a continuous arms race.
*   **Insider Threats:** Employees, whether malicious or negligent, can be a significant vulnerability.
*   **Third-Party Risks:** Supply chain attacks through vendors or partners can bypass internal security controls.
*   **Complexity of Ecosystem:** Managing security across multiple platforms (e-commerce, payments, logistics) and a vast network of users and partners increases attack surface.
*   **Talent Shortage:** A global shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals makes it challenging to staff and maintain cutting-edge defenses.
*   **Balancing Security with User Experience:** Overly stringent security measures can hinder user experience, leading to workarounds or user frustration.

## 6. What is the Opportunity I Have There?
