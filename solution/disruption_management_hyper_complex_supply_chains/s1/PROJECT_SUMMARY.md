# ResilienceNet Project Summary

**AI-Driven Supply Chain Resilience Platform for Walmart India**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

ResilienceNet is a comprehensive AI-driven platform designed to transform Walmart India's supply chain crisis management from reactive to proactive. The platform addresses the critical $100M+ annual exposure to unforeseen disruptions through advanced artificial intelligence, multi-agent simulation, and explainable decision support systems.

### Key Problem Solved
- **Decision-Making Gap**: Current systems detect disruptions but fail to predict cascading effects
- **Response Time**: Manual processes require hours/days; ResilienceNet reduces this to minutes
- **Cost Impact**: Potential savings of $8-12M annually through proactive risk management

---

## 🚀 Solution Highlights

### Core Innovations
1. **Predictive Risk Intelligence**: Real-time anomaly detection and multi-dimensional risk scoring
2. **Graph-Based Impact Modeling**: Cascading failure prediction through network analysis
3. **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Bottom-up modeling of supply chain entity behaviors
4. **Explainable AI**: Transparent reasoning for all recommendations and predictions

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Python-based microservices with Flask APIs
- **Frontend**: React dashboard with real-time visualizations
- **AI/ML**: Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Graph Neural Networks
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time series data
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes-ready containerized architecture
