## Risk Assessment

### Understanding Risk Scores

ResilienceNet calculates risk scores using a sophisticated AI model that considers multiple factors:

**Risk Factors:**
- **Supplier Reliability** (35% weight): Historical performance and financial stability
- **Transportation Capacity** (25% weight): Available capacity and route diversity
- **Inventory Levels** (20% weight): Stock adequacy and turnover rates
- **Demand Volatility** (15% weight): Demand predictability and seasonality
- **External Factors** (5% weight): Geopolitical and environmental risks

**Risk Score Interpretation:**
- **0-20**: Minimal risk, standard monitoring
- **21-40**: Low risk, routine oversight
- **41-60**: Moderate risk, increased attention
- **61-80**: High risk, active management required
- **81-100**: Critical risk, immediate intervention needed

### Performing Risk Assessments

**Quick Assessment:**
1. Navigate to the Risk Assessment page
2. Select the entity (supplier, DC, product, or route)
3. Click "Assess Risk" for immediate evaluation
4. Review the generated risk score and contributing factors

**Detailed Assessment:**
