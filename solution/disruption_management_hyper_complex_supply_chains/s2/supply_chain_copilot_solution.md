- **Focused**: Solves one specific problem exceptionally well
- **Scalable**: Can be integrated with existing Walmart Luminate data infrastructure

## 1. Problem Statement: The Critical Gap in Crisis Decision-Making

Walmart India's supply chain managers face a persistent challenge during disruptions: **the inability to quickly evaluate the cascading effects of different intervention strategies**. While Walmart's Element AI platform and Luminate suite provide excellent predictive capabilities under normal conditions, they fall short when managers need to rapidly assess counterfactual scenarios during crises.

### The Current Pain Point

When a major disruption occurs (e.g., port blockage, natural disaster, geopolitical event), supply chain managers must make critical decisions within hours:

- Should we air-freight high-value goods?
- Which suppliers should we prioritize for expedited shipping?
- How do we allocate limited inventory across regions?
- What is the cost-benefit trade-off of each intervention?

Currently, these decisions rely on:
- **Manual calculations** that take hours or days
- **Historical precedents** that may not apply to novel situations
- **Gut instinct** from experienced managers
- **Static models** that cannot quickly adapt to new scenarios

### The Business Impact

This decision-making lag results in:
- **Suboptimal resource allocation** during critical periods
- **Missed opportunities** to minimize disruption impact
- **Inconsistent responses** across different managers and regions
- **Higher costs** due to reactive rather than proactive interventions

**Visualization Library**: Recharts provides professional-quality charts and graphs that clearly communicate complex data relationships. The visualizations include pie charts for risk distribution, bar charts for cost-benefit analysis, and summary cards for key metrics.

**Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures the application works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, critical for managers who may need to access the tool during crisis situations.

### 9.3 Simulation Algorithm

The core simulation algorithm implements a simplified causal model that captures the key relationships in supply chain disruptions:

**Disruption Impact Calculation**: 
```
disruption_impact = severity × disruption_type_multiplier
affected_demand = base_demand × (1 + disruption_impact)
days_until_stockout = current_stock ÷ affected_demand
stockout_probability = f(days_until_stockout, recovery_time)
```

**Intervention Effectiveness**:
```
recovery_factor = intervention_recovery_rate × (1 - disruption_severity × 0.5)
new_disruption_impact = original_impact × (1 - recovery_factor)
intervention_cost = affected_units × cost_per_unit
revenue_saved = (original_stockout_prob - new_stockout_prob) × revenue_potential
```

This simplified model captures the essential causal relationships while remaining computationally efficient and interpretable.

### 9.4 Data Model

The application uses a structured data model that represents key supply chain entities:

**SKU Model**:

- Base demand (monthly units)
- Current stock levels
- Category-specific vulnerability factors

**Disruption Model**:
- Type identifier and human-readable name
- Affected product categories
- Severity multiplier (impact factor)
- Typical duration range

**Intervention Model**:
- Strategy identifier and description
- Cost per unit affected
- Recovery rate (effectiveness factor)
- Implementation timeline

### 9.5 Scalability Considerations

While the current implementation uses mock data for demonstration purposes, the architecture is designed to integrate with Walmart's existing data infrastructure:

**Data Integration Points**: The backend API can be easily modified to connect to Walmart's Luminate data platform, replacing mock data with real-time inventory, demand, and supplier information.

**Performance Optimization**: The simulation algorithms are designed to handle larger datasets efficiently. For production deployment, caching mechanisms and database optimization would ensure sub-second response times even with thousands of SKUs.
